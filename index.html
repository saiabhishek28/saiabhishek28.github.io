      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Controls Engineer working on industrial electrical and control systems for process automation and
        CO<sub>2</sub> liquefaction plants. My interests lie in practical control implementation, system reliability,
        and bridging rigorous control theory with real-world engineering constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in
        systems and control.

        <strong>Influence of Discretization on Hypersampled Model Predictive Control</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="abstract">
        This thesis studies the capabilities of Hypersampled Model Predictive Control (HMPC), a new technique that aims
        to reduce the computational cost of MPC by changing how the optimal control problem is discretized. The thesis
        primarily focuses on understanding the influence of discretization on HMPC and experimenting with three
        distinct discretization methods (schemes). Each scheme is characterized by varying the discretization time at
        each step. These schemes influence how the controller predicts and reacts to changes, thereby affecting its
        overall performance. The experiments are designed to provide insights into how each method impacts the
        performance of HMPC, particularly in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. The results
        are expected to be crucial in determining the most effective approach to implementing HMPC in various practical
        applications depending on system specifications.
